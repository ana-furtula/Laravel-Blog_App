Traditional brain health monitoring technology like EEG machines and polysomnograms are too bulky for home use, requiring patients to stay overnight at hospitals or sleep study clinics for observation. The high cost of care and lack of comfort of these devices makes long-term and continuous monitoring nearly impossible. Not only are these data based on a single timeframe, they observe what is anything but an ordinary nightâ€™s sleep. And for anyone living with epilepsy, the unpredictability of seizures makes direct observation and high-quality data-gathering exceedingly rare.'
